  <div class="about-personal">
    <p class="about-text">I am a software developer graduating in 2022 with a bachelor of Science in Software
      Development.
      I have the most experience in Java, but I am also comfortable with JavaScript, Kotlin and Python.
      My heart's desire is currently security and truly believe that is the crucial foundation of every technology
      today
      and should be higher prioritized. I do also enjoy the fun in making creative websites.
      I am a fast learner and find myself enjoying most topics, being networking, databases, operating systems or app
      development.

      <br>
      My finest feature is that I tend to get things done.
      <br>
      <br>
      When I'm not in front of the computer I like to be out in nature. My dog and I like to go hiking and we have
      often follow Sk√•neleden. Learn more about me to the right.
